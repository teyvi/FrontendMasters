      I love to make some spare time to do things I love to do. Having a third
      space is great for a good mental health

    <blockquote>
        <p>As Ray states in The Great Good Place, the nature of a third place is one in which the presence of a "regular" is always welcome, although never required. Membership is a simple, fluid process of frequent social contact, renewed each time by choice of the people involved. Eventually, social bonds develop through a type of informal intimacy. The important aspect of these relationships is that they occur outside of any commitment and exist solely in the realm of <strong>basic human respect</strong> . I ascribe huge importance to this one point because it is this one valuable kernel that is slipping away from our <em>isolated </em>modern world. I think that we all miss its presence and this affects us all in very slight, painful ways</p>
